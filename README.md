A web toy generating rhymed metrical verse using the CMU pronouncing
dictionary. Try it at http://wry.me/sonnetron/. Derived from
https://github.com/darius/languagetoys/blob/master/simpleverse.py (but
fancier now; but note that simpleverse can also generate use
higher-order models and produce other verse forms -- you can see both
in https://gist.github.com/darius/2371822 ).

Thanks to Shae Erisson, Flourish Klink, and Halsted Bernard for beta
feedback.

To run this locally: point your browser at index.html.

To understand the code, you need to understand the data it's using.
See 'About the CMU dictionary' and 'Phoneme set' at
http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict
So, for example, one pronunciation of 'hello' is encoded as
`HH AH0 L OW1`.

To rebuild the dictionary, you need some files not in the repo, and
not handy to me (I'm on an extended trip). If you had them, you'd then:

  * Fetch cmudict.0.7a into this directory, from
    http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict
    or specifically: `wget https://cmusphinx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cmusphinx/trunk/cmudict/cmudict.0.7a`.

  * Run `make`. This filters and compresses the dictionary for the
    Javascript code's use. (For a more human vocabulary, quicker start,
    and lower bandwidth bills.)
